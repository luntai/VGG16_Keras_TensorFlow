VGG16_Keras_TensorFlow
====  
This is an image classification by VGG16 pre-trained model.
# Envoriment #
Python3.5<br />
Keras2.0<br />
TensorFlow<br />
Windows10<br />
Most py-package (such like numpy or cv2...) you can install by pip install xx.whl from [here.](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ "pythonlibs")  

# Steps #
[Find and download](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases)
the weight file 'vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5' into the
directory ./data/model.
  
# Used Files #
_model/synset_words.txt_ : map class id (which is equal to line id) to synset_id and human words.
		   For example, If you get the prediction id is 281, then you should out put the 281th content in                 synset_words.txt.
_model/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5_: special VGG16 pre-trained weight file for Keras2.

# Hint #
Mind the path which is used in windows. If you are UNIX player, should change the format.<br />
Any other errors happen you can check [my blog](http://www.cnblogs.com/luntai/p/6786500.html "轮胎的博客").<br />
You should be careful with the Keras's backend (th:theano or tf:tensorflow), because they have different mat size format.<br />
